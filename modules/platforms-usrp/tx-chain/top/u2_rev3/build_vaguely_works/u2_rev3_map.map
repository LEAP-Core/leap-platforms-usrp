WARNING:Place:1019 - A clock IOB / clock component pair have been found that are
   not placed at an optimal clock IOB / clock site pair. The clock component
   <cpld_clk_BUFGP/BUFG> is placed at site <BUFGMUX1>. The IO component
   <cpld_clk> is placed at site <AB14>.  This will not allow the use of the fast
   path between the IO and the Clock buffer. This is normally an ERROR but the
   CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on COMP.PIN <cpld_clk.PAD>
   allowing your design to continue.  This constraint disables all clock placer
   rules related to the specified COMP.PIN. The use of this override is highly
   discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended
   that this error condition be corrected in the design.
